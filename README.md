# Varisware Pi/pidev plugins

Varisware VarisDev package.

## Included

- `extensions/varisdev.ts` — replaces the startup header with the Varisware ASCII logo, keeps the tab/window title set to `VarisDev - <folder>`, and uses a small crow image-style loader with animated processing dots while the assistant is streaming.
- `themes/varisware.json` — Varisware purple terminal theme.

## Local test

```bash
pi -e ./extensions/varisdev.ts
```
